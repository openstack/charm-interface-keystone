Description: installs a WSGI application in place of a real URI for testing.
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Testing a WSGI application normally involves starting a server at a
        local host and port, then pointing your test code to that address.
        Instead, this library lets you intercept calls to any specific host/port
        combination and redirect them into a `WSGI application`_ importable by
        your test program. Thus, you can avoid spawning multiple processes or
        threads to test your Web app.
        
        How Does It Work?
        =================
        
        ``wsgi_intercept`` works by replacing ``httplib.HTTPConnection`` with a
        subclass, ``wsgi_intercept.WSGI_HTTPConnection``. This class then
        redirects specific server/port combinations into a WSGI application by
        emulating a socket. If no intercept is registered for the host and port
        requested, those requests are passed on to the standard handler.
        
        The functions ``add_wsgi_intercept(host, port, app_create_fn,
        script_name='')`` and ``remove_wsgi_intercept(host,port)`` specify
        which URLs should be redirect into what applications. Note especially
        that ``app_create_fn`` is a *function object* returning a WSGI
        application; ``script_name`` becomes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` in the WSGI app's
        environment, if set.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        ::
        
            pip install -U wsgi_intercept
        
        Packages Intercepted
        ====================
        
        Unfortunately each of the Web testing frameworks uses its own specific
        mechanism for making HTTP call-outs, so individual implementations are
        needed. At this time there are implementations for ``httplib2`` and
        ``requests`` in both Python 2 and 3, ``urllib2`` and ``httplib``
        in Python 2 and ``urllib.request`` and ``http.client`` in Python 3.
        
        If you are using Python 2 and need support for a different HTTP
        client, require a version of ``wsgi_intercept<0.6``. Earlier versions
        include support for ``webtest``, ``webunit`` and ``zope.testbrowser``.
        It is quite likely that support for these versions will be relatively
        easy to add back in to the new version.
        
        The best way to figure out how to use interception is to inspect
        `the tests`_. More comprehensive documentation available upon
        request.

        History
        =======
        
        Pursuant to Ian Bicking's `"best Web testing framework"`_ post, Titus
        Brown put together an `in-process HTTP-to-WSGI interception mechanism`_
        for his own Web testing system, twill_. Because the mechanism is pretty
        generic -- it works at the httplib level -- Titus decided to try adding
        it into all of the *other* Python Web testing frameworks.
        
        The Python 2 version of wsgi-intercept was the result. Kumar McMillan
        later took over maintenance.
        
        The current version works with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 and was assembled
        by `Chris Dent`_. Testing and documentation improvements from `Sasha Hart`_.
