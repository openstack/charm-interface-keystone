.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Bazaar (or bzr) is a distributed version control system that is powerful, 
friendly, and scalable.  Bazaar is a project of Canonical Ltd and part of 
the GNU Project to develop a free operating system.

Bazaar keeps track of changes to software source code (or similar information);
lets you explore who changed it, when, and why; merges concurrent changes; and
helps people work together in a team.

See also: ignore, remove

Add specified files or directories.

In non\-recursive mode, all the named items are added, regardless
of whether they were previously ignored.  A warning is given if
any of the named files are already versioned.

In recursive mode (the default), files are treated the same way
but the behaviour for directories is different.  Directories that
are already versioned do not give a warning.  All directories,
whether already versioned or not, are searched for files or
subdirectories that are neither versioned or ignored, and these
are added.  This search proceeds recursively into versioned
directories.  If no names are given \*(Aq.\*(Aq is assumed.

A warning will be printed when nested trees are encountered,
unless they are explicitly ignored.

Therefore simply saying \*(Aqbzr add\*(Aq will version all files that
are currently unknown.

Adding a file whose parent directory is not versioned will
implicitly add the parent, and so on up to the root. This means
you should never need to explicitly add a directory, they\*(Aqll just
get added when you add a file in the directory.

\-\-dry\-run will show which files would be added, but not actually
add them.

\-\-file\-ids\-from will try to use the file ids from the supplied path.
It looks up ids trying to find a matching parent directory with the
same filename, and then by pure path. This option is rarely needed
but can be useful when adding the same logical file into two
branches that will be merged later (without showing the two different
adds as a conflict). It is also useful when merging another project
into a subdirectory of this one.

Any files matching patterns in the ignore list will not be added
unless they are explicitly mentioned.

In recursive mode, files larger than the configuration option 
add.maximum_file_size will be skipped. Named items are never skipped due
to file size.

Convert the current branch into a checkout of the supplied branch.
If no branch is supplied, rebind to the last bound location.

Once converted into a checkout, commits must succeed on the master branch
before they will be applied to the local branch.

Bound branches use the nickname of its master branch unless it is set
locally, in which case binding will update the local nickname to be
that of the master.

Aliases: get, clone

See also: checkout

Create a new branch that is a copy of an existing branch.

If the TO_LOCATION is omitted, the last component of the FROM_LOCATION will
be used.  In other words, "branch ../foo/bar" will attempt to create ./bar.
If the FROM_LOCATION has no / or path separator embedded, the TO_LOCATION
is derived from the FROM_LOCATION by stripping a leading scheme or drive
identifier, if any. For example, "branch lp:foo\-bar" will attempt to
create ./foo\-bar.

To retrieve the branch as of a particular revision, supply the \-\-revision
parameter, as in "branch foo/bar \-r 5".

The synonyms \*(Aqclone\*(Aq and \*(Aqget\*(Aq for this command are deprecated.

See also: reconcile

Validate working tree structure, branch consistency and repository history.

This command checks various invariants about branch and repository storage
to detect data corruption or bzr bugs.

The working tree and branch checks will only give output if a problem is
detected. The output fields of the repository check are:

revisions
    This is just the number of revisions checked.  It doesn\*(Aqt
    indicate a problem.

versionedfiles
    This is just the number of versionedfiles checked.  It
    doesn\*(Aqt indicate a problem.

unreferenced ancestors
    Texts that are ancestors of other texts, but
    are not properly referenced by the revision ancestry.  This is a
    subtle problem that Bazaar can work around.

unique file texts
    This is the total number of unique file contents
    seen in the checked revisions.  It does not indicate a problem.

repeated file texts
    This is the total number of repeated texts seen
    in the checked revisions.  Texts can be repeated when their file
    entries are modified, but the file contents are not.  It does not
    indicate a problem.

If no restrictions are specified, all Bazaar data that is found at the given
location will be checked.

Examples:

    Check the tree and branch at \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq:

        bzr check \-\-tree \-\-branch foo

    Check only the repository at \*(Aqbar\*(Aq:

        bzr check \-\-repo bar

    Check everything at \*(Aqbaz\*(Aq:

Alias: co

See also: branch, checkouts, remove\-tree, working\-trees

Create a new checkout of an existing branch.

If BRANCH_LOCATION is omitted, checkout will reconstitute a working tree for
the branch found in \*(Aq.\*(Aq. This is useful if you have removed the working tree
or if it was never created \- i.e. if you pushed the branch to its current
location using SFTP.

If the TO_LOCATION is omitted, the last component of the BRANCH_LOCATION will
be used.  In other words, "checkout ../foo/bar" will attempt to create ./bar.
If the BRANCH_LOCATION has no / or path separator embedded, the TO_LOCATION
is derived from the BRANCH_LOCATION by stripping a leading scheme or drive
identifier, if any. For example, "checkout lp:foo\-bar" will attempt to
create ./foo\-bar.

To retrieve the branch as of a particular revision, supply the \-\-revision
parameter, as in "checkout foo/bar \-r 5". Note that this will be immediately
out of date [so you cannot commit] but it may be useful (i.e. to examine old
code.)

Remove unwanted files from working tree.

By default, only unknown files, not ignored files, are deleted.  Versioned
files are never deleted.

Another class is \*(Aqdetritus\*(Aq, which includes files emitted by bzr during
normal operations and selftests.  (The value of these files decreases with
time.)

If no options are specified, unknown files are deleted.  Otherwise, option
flags are respected, and may be combined.

To check what clean\-tree will do, use \-\-dry\-run.

Aliases: ci, checkin

See also: add, bugs, hooks, uncommit

Commit changes into a new revision.

An explanatory message needs to be given for each commit. This is
often done by using the \-\-message option (getting the message from the
command line) or by using the \-\-file option (getting the message from
a file). If neither of these options is given, an editor is opened for
the user to enter the message. To see the changed files in the
boilerplate text loaded into the editor, use the \-\-show\-diff option.

By default, the entire tree is committed and the person doing the
commit is assumed to be the author. These defaults can be overridden
as explained below.

Selective commits:

  If selected files are specified, only changes to those files are
  committed.  If a directory is specified then the directory and
  everything within it is committed.

  When excludes are given, they take precedence over selected files.
  For example, to commit only changes within foo, but not changes
  within foo/bar:

    bzr commit foo \-x foo/bar

  A selective commit after a merge is not yet supported.

Custom authors:

  If the author of the change is not the same person as the committer,
  you can specify the author\*(Aqs name using the \-\-author option. The
  name should be in the same format as a committer\-id, e.g.
  "John Doe <jdoe@example.com>". If there is more than one author of
  the change you can specify the option multiple times, once for each
  author.

Checks:

  A common mistake is to forget to add a new file or directory before
  running the commit command. The \-\-strict option checks for unknown
  files and aborts the commit if any are found. More advanced pre\-commit
  checks can be implemented by defining hooks. See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help hooks\\*(Aq\\*(Aq
  for details.

Things to note:

  If you accidentially commit the wrong changes or make a spelling
  mistake in the commit message say, you can use the uncommit command
  to undo it. See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help uncommit\\*(Aq\\*(Aq for details.

  Hooks can also be configured to run after a commit. This allows you
  to trigger updates to external systems like bug trackers. The \-\-fixes
  option can be used to record the association between a revision and
  one or more bugs. See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help bugs\\*(Aq\\*(Aq for details.

See also: configuration

Display, set or remove a configuration option.

Display the active value for option NAME.

If \-\-all is specified, NAME is interpreted as a regular expression and all
matching options are displayed mentioning their scope and without resolving
option references in the value). The active value that bzr will take into
account is the first one displayed for each option.

If NAME is not given, \-\-all .* is implied (all options are displayed for the
current scope).

Setting a value is achieved by using NAME=value without spaces. The value
is set in the most relevant scope and can be checked by displaying the
option again.

Removing a value is achieved by using \-\-remove NAME.

See also: conflict\-types, resolve

List files with conflicts.

Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those,
it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something,
before you can commit.

Conflicts normally are listed as short, human\-readable messages.  If \-\-text
is supplied, the pathnames of files with text conflicts are listed,
instead.  (This is useful for editing all files with text conflicts.)

Use bzr resolve when you have fixed a problem.

Aliases: di, dif

See also: status

Show differences in the working tree, between revisions or branches.

If no arguments are given, all changes for the current tree are listed.
If files are given, only the changes in those files are listed.
Remote and multiple branches can be compared by using the \-\-old and
\-\-new options. If not provided, the default for both is derived from
the first argument, if any, or the current tree if no arguments are
given.

"bzr diff \-p1" is equivalent to "bzr diff \-\-prefix old/:new/", and
produces patches suitable for "patch \-p1".

Note that when using the \-r argument with a range of revisions, the
differences are computed between the two specified revisions.  That
is, the command does not show the changes introduced by the first 
revision in the range.  This differs from the interpretation of 
revision ranges used by "bzr log" which includes the first revision
in the range.

Exit values:
    1 \- changed
    2 \- unrepresentable changes
    3 \- error
    0 \- no change

Examples:
    Shows the difference in the working tree versus the last commit:

        bzr diff

    Difference between the working tree and revision 1:

        bzr diff \-r1

    Difference between revision 3 and revision 1:

        bzr diff \-r1..3

    Difference between revision 3 and revision 1 for branch xxx:

        bzr diff \-r1..3 xxx

    The changes introduced by revision 2 (equivalent to \-r1..2):

        bzr diff \-c2

    To see the changes introduced by revision X:
    
        bzr diff \-cX

    Note that in the case of a merge, the \-c option shows the changes
    compared to the left hand parent. To see the changes against
    another parent, use:

        bzr diff \-r<chosen_parent>..X

    The changes between the current revision and the previous revision
    (equivalent to \-c\-1 and \-r\-2..\-1)

        bzr diff \-r\-2..

    Show just the differences for file NEWS:

        bzr diff NEWS

    Show the differences in working tree xxx for file NEWS:

        bzr diff xxx/NEWS

    Show the differences from branch xxx to this working tree:

        bzr diff \-\-old xxx

    Show the differences between two branches for file NEWS:

If no revision is specified this exports the last committed revision.

Format may be an "exporter" name, such as tar, tgz, tbz2.  If none is
given, try to find the format with the extension. If no extension
is found exports to a directory (equivalent to \-\-format=dir).

If root is supplied, it will be used as the root directory inside
container formats (tar, zip, etc). If it is not supplied it will default
to the exported filename. The root option has no effect for \*(Aqdir\*(Aq format.

If branch is omitted then the branch containing the current working
directory will be used.

See also: ignored, patterns, status

Ignore specified files or patterns.

See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help patterns\\*(Aq\\*(Aq for details on the syntax of patterns.

If a .bzrignore file does not exist, the ignore command
will create one and add the specified files or patterns to the newly
created file. The ignore command will also automatically add the .bzrignore file to be versioned. Creating a .bzrignore file without
the use of the ignore command will require an explicit add command.

To remove patterns from the ignore list, edit the .bzrignore file.
After adding, editing or deleting that file either indirectly by
using this command or directly by using an editor, be sure to commit
it.

Bazaar also supports a global ignore file ~/.bazaar/ignore. On Windows
the global ignore file can be found in the application data directory as
C:\\Documents and Settings\\<user>\\Application Data\\Bazaar\\2.0\\ignore.
Global ignores are not touched by this command. The global ignore file
can be edited directly using an editor.

Patterns prefixed with \*(Aq!\*(Aq are exceptions to ignore patterns and take
precedence over regular ignores.  Such exceptions are used to specify
files that should be versioned which would otherwise be ignored.

Patterns prefixed with \*(Aq!!\*(Aq act as regular ignore patterns, but have
precedence over the \*(Aq!\*(Aq exception patterns.

Notes: 
    
* Ignore patterns containing shell wildcards must be quoted from
  the shell on Unix.

* Ignore patterns starting with "#" act as comments in the ignore file.
  To ignore patterns that begin with that character, use the "RE:" prefix.

Examples:
    Ignore the top level Makefile:

        bzr ignore ./Makefile

    Ignore .class files in all directories...:

        bzr ignore "*.class"

    ...but do not ignore "special.class":

        bzr ignore "!special.class"

    Ignore files whose name begins with the "#" character:

        bzr ignore "RE:^#"

    Ignore .o files under the lib directory:

        bzr ignore "lib/**/*.o"

    Ignore .o files under the lib directory:

        bzr ignore "RE:lib/.*\\.o"

    Ignore everything but the "debian" toplevel directory:

        bzr ignore "RE:(?!debian/).*"
    
    Ignore everything except the "local" toplevel directory,
    but always ignore autosave files ending in ~, even under local/:
    
        bzr ignore "*"
        bzr ignore "!./local"
        bzr ignore "!!*~"

See also: branch, checkout, init\-repository

Make a directory into a versioned branch.

Use this to create an empty branch, or before importing an
existing project.

If there is a repository in a parent directory of the location, then
the history of the branch will be stored in the repository.  Otherwise
init creates a standalone branch which carries its own history
in the .bzr directory.

If there is already a branch at the location but it has no working tree,
the tree can be populated with \*(Aqbzr checkout\*(Aq.

Alias: init\-repo

See also: branch, checkout, init, repositories

Create a shared repository for branches to share storage space.

New branches created under the repository directory will store their
revisions in the repository, not in the branch directory.  For branches
with shared history, this reduces the amount of storage needed and 
speeds up the creation of new branches.

If the \-\-no\-trees option is given then the branches in the repository
will not have working trees by default.  They will still exist as 
directories on disk, but they will not have separate copies of the 
files at a certain revision.  This can be useful for repositories that
store branches which are interacted with through checkouts or remote
branches, such as on a server.

Examples:
    Create a shared repository holding just branches:

        bzr init\-repo \-\-no\-trees repo
        bzr init repo/trunk

    Make a lightweight checkout elsewhere:

        bzr checkout \-\-lightweight repo/trunk trunk\-checkout
        cd trunk\-checkout
        (add files here)

See also: split

Combine a tree into its containing tree.

This command requires the target tree to be in a rich\-root format.

The TREE argument should be an independent tree, inside another tree, but
not part of it.  (Such trees can be produced by "bzr split", but also by
running "bzr branch" with the target inside a tree.)

The result is a combined tree, with the subtree no longer an independent
part.  This is marked as a merge of the subtree into the containing tree,
and all history is preserved.

See also: log\-formats, revisionspec

Show historical log for a branch or subset of a branch.

log is bzr\*(Aqs default tool for exploring the history of a branch.
The branch to use is taken from the first parameter. If no parameters
are given, the branch containing the working directory is logged.
Here are some simple examples:

  bzr log                       log the current branch
  bzr log foo.py                log a file in its branch
  bzr log http://server/branch  log a branch on a server

The filtering, ordering and information shown for each revision can
be controlled as explained below. By default, all revisions are
shown sorted (topologically) so that newer revisions appear before
older ones and descendants always appear before ancestors. If displayed,
merged revisions are shown indented under the revision in which they
were merged.

Output control:

  The log format controls how information about each revision is
  displayed. The standard log formats are called \\*(Aq\\*(Aqlong\\*(Aq\\*(Aq, \\*(Aq\\*(Aqshort\\*(Aq\\*(Aq
  and \\*(Aq\\*(Aqline\\*(Aq\\*(Aq. The default is long. See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help log\-formats\\*(Aq\\*(Aq
  for more details on log formats.

  The following options can be used to control what information is
  displayed:

    \-l N        display a maximum of N revisions
    \-n N        display N levels of revisions (0 for all, 1 for collapsed)
    \-v          display a status summary (delta) for each revision
    \-p          display a diff (patch) for each revision
    \-\-show\-ids  display revision\-ids (and file\-ids), not just revnos

  Note that the default number of levels to display is a function of the
  log format. If the \-n option is not used, the standard log formats show
  just the top level (mainline).

  Status summaries are shown using status flags like A, M, etc. To see
  the changes explained using words like \\*(Aq\\*(Aqadded\\*(Aq\\*(Aq and \\*(Aq\\*(Aqmodified\\*(Aq\\*(Aq
  instead, use the \-vv option.

Ordering control:

  To display revisions from oldest to newest, use the \-\-forward option.
  In most cases, using this option will have little impact on the total
  time taken to produce a log, though \-\-forward does not incrementally
  display revisions like \-\-reverse does when it can.

Revision filtering:

  The \-r option can be used to specify what revision or range of revisions
  to filter against. The various forms are shown below:

    \-rX      display revision X
    \-rX..    display revision X and later
    \-r..Y    display up to and including revision Y
    \-rX..Y   display from X to Y inclusive

  See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help revisionspec\\*(Aq\\*(Aq for details on how to specify X and Y.
  Some common examples are given below:

    \-r\-1                show just the tip
    \-r\-10..             show the last 10 mainline revisions
    \-rsubmit:..         show what\*(Aqs new on this branch
    \-rancestor:path..   show changes since the common ancestor of this
                        branch and the one at location path
    \-rdate:yesterday..  show changes since yesterday

  When logging a range of revisions using \-rX..Y, log starts at
  revision Y and searches back in history through the primary
  ("left\-hand") parents until it finds X. When logging just the
  top level (using \-n1), an error is reported if X is not found
  along the way. If multi\-level logging is used (\-n0), X may be
  a nested merge revision and the log will be truncated accordingly.

Path filtering:

  If parameters are given and the first one is not a branch, the log
  will be filtered to show only those revisions that changed the
  nominated files or directories.

  Filenames are interpreted within their historical context. To log a
  deleted file, specify a revision range so that the file existed at
  the end or start of the range.

  Historical context is also important when interpreting pathnames of
  renamed files/directories. Consider the following example:

  * revision 1: add tutorial.txt
  * revision 2: modify tutorial.txt
  * revision 3: rename tutorial.txt to guide.txt; add tutorial.txt

  In this case:

  * \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr log guide.txt\\*(Aq\\*(Aq will log the file added in revision 1

  * \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr log tutorial.txt\\*(Aq\\*(Aq will log the new file added in revision 3

  * \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr log \-r2 \-p tutorial.txt\\*(Aq\\*(Aq will show the changes made to
    the original file in revision 2.

  * \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr log \-r2 \-p guide.txt\\*(Aq\\*(Aq will display an error message as there
    was no file called guide.txt in revision 2.

  Renames are always followed by log. By design, there is no need to
  explicitly ask for this (and no way to stop logging a file back
  until it was last renamed).

Other filtering:

  The \-\-match option can be used for finding revisions that match a
  regular expression in a commit message, committer, author or bug.
  Specifying the option several times will match any of the supplied
  expressions. \-\-match\-author, \-\-match\-bugs, \-\-match\-committer and
  \-\-match\-message can be used to only match a specific field.

Tips & tricks:

  GUI tools and IDEs are often better at exploring history than command
  line tools: you may prefer qlog or viz from qbzr or bzr\-gtk, the
  bzr\-explorer shell, or the Loggerhead web interface.  See the Plugin
  Guide <http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/> and
  <http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/IDEIntegration>.  

  You may find it useful to add the aliases below to \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbazaar.conf\\*(Aq\\*(Aq:

    [ALIASES]
    tip = log \-r\-1
    top = log \-l10 \-\-line
    show = log \-v \-p

  \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr tip\\*(Aq\\*(Aq will then show the latest revision while \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr top\\*(Aq\\*(Aq
  will show the last 10 mainline revisions. To see the details of a
  particular revision X,  \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr show \-rX\\*(Aq\\*(Aq.

  If you are interested in looking deeper into a particular merge X,
  use \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr log \-n0 \-rX\\*(Aq\\*(Aq.

  \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr log \-v\\*(Aq\\*(Aq on a branch with lots of history is currently
  very slow. A fix for this issue is currently under development.
  With or without that fix, it is recommended that a revision range
  be given when using the \-v option.

  bzr has a generic full\-text matching plugin, bzr\-search, that can be
  used to find revisions matching user names, commit messages, etc.
  Among other features, this plugin can find all revisions containing
  a list of words but not others.

  When exploring non\-mainline history on large projects with deep
  history, the performance of log can be greatly improved by installing
  the historycache plugin. This plugin buffers historical information
  trading disk space for faster speed.

See also: remerge, send, status\-flags, update

Perform a three\-way merge.

The source of the merge can be specified either in the form of a branch,
or in the form of a path to a file containing a merge directive generated
with bzr send. If neither is specified, the default is the upstream branch
or the branch most recently merged using \-\-remember.  The source of the
merge may also be specified in the form of a path to a file in another
branch:  in this case, only the modifications to that file are merged into
the current working tree.

When merging from a branch, by default bzr will try to merge in all new
work from the other branch, automatically determining an appropriate base
revision.  If this fails, you may need to give an explicit base.

To pick a different ending revision, pass "\-\-revision OTHER".  bzr will
try to merge in all new work up to and including revision OTHER.

If you specify two values, "\-\-revision BASE..OTHER", only revisions BASE
through OTHER, excluding BASE but including OTHER, will be merged.  If this
causes some revisions to be skipped, i.e. if the destination branch does
not already contain revision BASE, such a merge is commonly referred to as
a "cherrypick". Unlike a normal merge, Bazaar does not currently track
cherrypicks. The changes look like a normal commit, and the history of the
changes from the other branch is not stored in the commit.

Revision numbers are always relative to the source branch.

Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those,
it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something,
before you can commit.

Use bzr resolve when you have fixed a problem.  See also bzr conflicts.

If there is no default branch set, the first merge will set it (use
\-\-no\-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the branch
to use the default.  To change the default, use \-\-remember. The value will
only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.

The results of the merge are placed into the destination working
directory, where they can be reviewed (with bzr diff), tested, and then
committed to record the result of the merge.

merge refuses to run if there are any uncommitted changes, unless
\-\-force is given.  If \-\-force is given, then the changes from the source 
will be merged with the current working tree, including any uncommitted
changes in the tree.  The \-\-force option can also be used to create a
merge revision which has more than two parents.

If one would like to merge changes from the working tree of the other
branch without merging any committed revisions, the \-\-uncommitted option
can be given.

To select only some changes to merge, use "merge \-i", which will prompt
you to apply each diff hunk and file change, similar to "shelve".

Examples:
    To merge all new revisions from bzr.dev:

        bzr merge ../bzr.dev

    To merge changes up to and including revision 82 from bzr.dev:

        bzr merge \-r 82 ../bzr.dev

    To merge the changes introduced by 82, without previous changes:

        bzr merge \-r 81..82 ../bzr.dev

    To apply a merge directive contained in /tmp/merge:

        bzr merge /tmp/merge

    To create a merge revision with three parents from two branches
    feature1a and feature1b:

        bzr merge ../feature1a
        bzr merge ../feature1b \-\-force
        bzr commit \-m \*(Aqrevision with three parents\*(Aq

Aliases: move, rename

Move or rename a file.

Usage:
    bzr mv OLDNAME NEWNAME

    bzr mv SOURCE... DESTINATION

If the last argument is a versioned directory, all the other names
are moved into it.  Otherwise, there must be exactly two arguments
and the file is changed to a new name.

If OLDNAME does not exist on the filesystem but is versioned and
NEWNAME does exist on the filesystem but is not versioned, mv
assumes that the file has been manually moved and only updates
its internal inventory to reflect that change.
The same is valid when moving many SOURCE files to a DESTINATION.

Files cannot be moved between branches.

See also: repositories

Compress the data within a repository.

This operation compresses the data within a bazaar repository. As
bazaar supports automatic packing of repository, this operation is
normally not required to be done manually.

During the pack operation, bazaar takes a backup of existing repository
data, i.e. pack files. This backup is eventually removed by bazaar
automatically when it is safe to do so. To save disk space by removing
the backed up pack files, the \-\-clean\-obsolete\-packs option may be
used.

Warning: If you use \-\-clean\-obsolete\-packs and your machine crashes
during or immediately after repacking, you may be left with a state
where the deletion has been written to disk but the new packs have not
been. In this case the repository may be unusable.

List the installed plugins.

This command displays the list of installed plugins including
version of plugin and a short description of each.

\-\-verbose shows the path where each plugin is located.

A plugin is an external component for Bazaar that extends the
revision control system, by adding or replacing code in Bazaar.
Plugins can do a variety of things, including overriding commands,
adding new commands, providing additional network transports and
customizing log output.

See the Bazaar Plugin Guide <http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/plugins/en/>
for further information on plugins including where to find them and how to
install them. Instructions are also provided there on how to write new
plugins using the Python programming language.

See also: push, send, status\-flags, update

Turn this branch into a mirror of another branch.

By default, this command only works on branches that have not diverged.
Branches are considered diverged if the destination branch\*(Aqs most recent 
commit is one that has not been merged (directly or indirectly) into the 
parent.

If branches have diverged, you can use \*(Aqbzr merge\*(Aq to integrate the changes
from one into the other.  Once one branch has merged, the other should
be able to pull it again.

If you want to replace your local changes and just want your branch to
match the remote one, use pull \-\-overwrite. This will work even if the two
branches have diverged.

If there is no default location set, the first pull will set it (use
\-\-no\-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can omit the
location to use the default.  To change the default, use \-\-remember. The
value will only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.

The \-\-verbose option will display the revisions pulled using the log_format
configuration option. You can use a different format by overriding it with
\-Olog_format=<other_format>.

Note: The location can be specified either in the form of a branch,
or in the form of a path to a file containing a merge directive generated
with bzr send.

See also: pull, update, working\-trees

Update a mirror of this branch.

The target branch will not have its working tree populated because this
is both expensive, and is not supported on remote file systems.

Some smart servers or protocols *may* put the working tree in place in
the future.

This command only works on branches that have not diverged.  Branches are
considered diverged if the destination branch\*(Aqs most recent commit is one
that has not been merged (directly or indirectly) by the source branch.

If branches have diverged, you can use \*(Aqbzr push \-\-overwrite\*(Aq to replace
the other branch completely, discarding its unmerged changes.

If you want to ensure you have the different changes in the other branch,
do a merge (see bzr help merge) from the other branch, and commit that.
After that you will be able to do a push without \*(Aq\-\-overwrite\*(Aq.

If there is no default push location set, the first push will set it (use
\-\-no\-remember to avoid setting it).  After that, you can omit the
location to use the default.  To change the default, use \-\-remember. The
value will only be saved if the remote location can be accessed.

The \-\-verbose option will display the revisions pushed using the log_format
configuration option. You can use a different format by overriding it with
\-Olog_format=<other_format>.

Reconcile bzr metadata in a branch.

This can correct data mismatches that may have been caused by
previous ghost operations or bzr upgrades. You should only
need to run this command if \*(Aqbzr check\*(Aq or a bzr developer
advises you to run it.

If a second branch is provided, cross\-branch reconciliation is
also attempted, which will check that data like the tree root
id which was not present in very early bzr versions is represented
correctly in both branches.

At the same time it is run it may recompress data resulting in
a potential saving in disk space or performance gain.

Register a branch with launchpad.net.

This command lists a bzr branch in the directory of branches on
launchpad.net.  Registration allows the branch to be associated with
bugs or specifications.

Before using this command you must register the project to which the
branch belongs, and create an account for yourself on launchpad.net.

arguments:
    public_url: The publicly visible url for the branch to register.
                This must be an http or https url (which Launchpad can read
                from to access the branch). Local file urls, SFTP urls, and
                bzr+ssh urls will not work.
                If no public_url is provided, bzr will use the configured
                public_url if there is one for the current branch, and
                otherwise error.

    bzr register\-branch http://foo.com/bzr/fooproject.mine \\

Redo a merge.

Use this if you want to try a different merge technique while resolving
conflicts.  Some merge techniques are better than others, and remerge
lets you try different ones on different files.

The options for remerge have the same meaning and defaults as the ones for
merge.  The difference is that remerge can (only) be run when there is a
pending merge, and it lets you specify particular files.

Examples:
    Re\-do the merge of all conflicted files, and show the base text in
    conflict regions, in addition to the usual THIS and OTHER texts:

        bzr remerge \-\-show\-base

    Re\-do the merge of "foobar", using the weave merge algorithm, with
    additional processing to reduce the size of conflict regions:

        bzr remerge \-\-merge\-type weave \-\-reprocess foobar

Alias: resolved

See also: conflicts

Mark a conflict as resolved.

Merge will do its best to combine the changes in two branches, but there
are some kinds of problems only a human can fix.  When it encounters those,
it will mark a conflict.  A conflict means that you need to fix something,
before you can commit.

Once you have fixed a problem, use "bzr resolve" to automatically mark
text conflicts as fixed, "bzr resolve FILE" to mark a specific conflict as
resolved, or "bzr resolve \-\-all" to mark all conflicts as resolved.

See also: cat, export, merge, shelve

Set files in the working tree back to the contents of a previous revision.

Giving a list of files will revert only those files.  Otherwise, all files
will be reverted.  If the revision is not specified with \*(Aq\-\-revision\*(Aq, the
working tree basis revision is used. A revert operation affects only the
working tree, not any revision history like the branch and repository or
the working tree basis revision.

To remove only some changes, without reverting to a prior version, use
merge instead.  For example, "merge . \-r \-2..\-3" (don\*(Aqt forget the ".")
will remove the changes introduced by the second last commit (\-2), without
affecting the changes introduced by the last commit (\-1).  To remove
certain changes on a hunk\-by\-hunk basis, see the shelve command.
To update the branch to a specific revision or the latest revision and
update the working tree accordingly while preserving local changes, see the
update command.

Uncommitted changes to files that are reverted will be discarded.
Howver, by default, any files that have been manually changed will be
backed up first.  (Files changed only by merge are not backed up.)  Backup
files have \*(Aq.~#~\*(Aq appended to their name, where # is a number.

When you provide files, you can use their current pathname or the pathname
from the target revision.  So you can use revert to "undelete" a file by
name.  If you name a directory, all the contents of that directory will be
reverted.

If you have newly added files since the target revision, they will be
removed.  If the files to be removed have been changed, backups will be
created as above.  Directories containing unknown files will not be
deleted.

The working tree contains a list of revisions that have been merged but
not yet committed. These revisions will be included as additional parents
of the next commit.  Normally, using revert clears that list as well as
reverting the files.  If any files are specified, revert leaves the list
of uncommitted merges alone and reverts only the files.  Use \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr revert.\\*(Aq\\*(Aq in the tree root to revert all files but keep the recorded merges,
and \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr revert \-\-forget\-merges\\*(Aq\\*(Aq to clear the pending merge list without
reverting any files.

Using "bzr revert \-\-forget\-merges", it is possible to apply all of the
changes from a branch in a single revision.  To do this, perform the merge
as desired.  Then doing revert with the "\-\-forget\-merges" option will keep
the content of the tree as it was, but it will clear the list of pending
merges.  The next commit will then contain all of the changes that are
present in the other branch, but without any other parent revisions.
Because this technique forgets where these changes originated, it may
cause additional conflicts on later merges involving the same source and
target branches.

See also: merge, pull

Mail or create a merge\-directive for submitting changes.

A merge directive provides many things needed for requesting merges:

* A machine\-readable description of the merge to perform

* An optional patch that is a preview of the changes requested

* An optional bundle of revision data, so that the changes can be applied
  directly from the merge directive, without retrieving data from a
  branch.

\\*(Aqbzr send\\*(Aq creates a compact data set that, when applied using bzr
merge, has the same effect as merging from the source branch.  

By default the merge directive is self\-contained and can be applied to any
branch containing submit_branch in its ancestory without needing access to
the source branch.

If \-\-no\-bundle is specified, then Bazaar doesn\*(Aqt send the contents of the
revisions, but only a structured request to merge from the
public_location.  In that case the public_branch is needed and it must be
up\-to\-date and accessible to the recipient.  The public_branch is always
included if known, so that people can check it later.

The submit branch defaults to the parent of the source branch, but can be
overridden.  Both submit branch and public branch will be remembered in
branch.conf the first time they are used for a particular branch.  The
source branch defaults to that containing the working directory, but can
be changed using \-\-from.

Both the submit branch and the public branch follow the usual behavior with
respect to \-\-remember: If there is no default location set, the first send
will set it (use \-\-no\-remember to avoid setting it). After that, you can
omit the location to use the default.  To change the default, use
\-\-remember. The value will only be saved if the location can be accessed.

In order to calculate those changes, bzr must analyse the submit branch.
Therefore it is most efficient for the submit branch to be a local mirror.
If a public location is known for the submit_branch, that location is used
in the merge directive.

The default behaviour is to send the merge directive by mail, unless \-o is
given, in which case it is sent to a file.

Mail is sent using your preferred mail program.  This should be transparent
on Windows (it uses MAPI).  On Unix, it requires the xdg\-email utility.
If the preferred client can\*(Aqt be found (or used), your editor will be used.

To use a specific mail program, set the mail_client configuration option.
(For Thunderbird 1.5, this works around some bugs.)  Supported values for
specific clients are "claws", "evolution", "kmail", "mail.app" (MacOS X\*(Aqs
Mail.app), "mutt", and "thunderbird"; generic options are "default",
"editor", "emacsclient", "mapi", and "xdg\-email".  Plugins may also add
supported clients.

If mail is being sent, a to address is required.  This can be supplied
either on the commandline, by setting the submit_to configuration
option in the branch itself or the child_submit_to configuration option
in the submit branch.

Two formats are currently supported: "4" uses revision bundle format 4 and
merge directive format 2.  It is significantly faster and smaller than
older formats.  It is compatible with Bazaar 0.19 and later.  It is the
default.  "0.9" uses revision bundle format 0.9 and merge directive
format 1.  It is compatible with Bazaar 0.12 \- 0.18.

The merge directives created by bzr send may be applied using bzr merge or
bzr pull by specifying a file containing a merge directive as the location.

bzr send makes extensive use of public locations to map local locations into
URLs that can be used by other people.  See \\*(Aqbzr help configuration\\*(Aq to
set them, and use \\*(Aqbzr info\\*(Aq to display them.

See also: configuration, unshelve

Temporarily set aside some changes from the current tree.

Shelve allows you to temporarily put changes you\*(Aqve made "on the shelf",
ie. out of the way, until a later time when you can bring them back from
the shelf with the \*(Aqunshelve\*(Aq command.  The changes are stored alongside
your working tree, and so they aren\*(Aqt propagated along with your branch nor
will they survive its deletion.

If shelve \-\-list is specified, previously\-shelved changes are listed.

Shelve is intended to help separate several sets of changes that have
been inappropriately mingled.  If you just want to get rid of all changes
and you don\*(Aqt need to restore them later, use revert.  If you want to
shelve all text changes at once, use shelve \-\-all.

If filenames are specified, only the changes to those files will be
shelved. Other files will be left untouched.

If a revision is specified, changes since that revision will be shelved.

You can put multiple items on the shelf, and by default, \*(Aqunshelve\*(Aq will
restore the most recently shelved changes.

For complicated changes, it is possible to edit the changes in a separate
editor program to decide what the file remaining in the working copy
should look like.  To do this, add the configuration option

    change_editor = PROGRAM @new_path @old_path

where @new_path is replaced with the path of the new version of the 
file and @old_path is replaced with the path of the old version of 
the file.  The PROGRAM should save the new file with the desired 
contents of the file in the working tree.

See also: join

Split a subdirectory of a tree into a separate tree.

This command will produce a target tree in a format that supports
rich roots, like \*(Aqrich\-root\*(Aq or \*(Aqrich\-root\-pack\*(Aq.  These formats cannot be
converted into earlier formats like \*(Aqdirstate\-tags\*(Aq.

The TREE argument should be a subdirectory of a working tree.  That
subdirectory will be converted into an independent tree, with its own
branch.  Commits in the top\-level tree will not apply to the new subtree.

Aliases: st, stat

See also: diff, revert, status\-flags

Display status summary.

This reports on versioned and unknown files, reporting them
grouped by state.  Possible states are:

added
    Versioned in the working copy but not in the previous revision.

removed
    Versioned in the previous revision but removed or deleted
    in the working copy.

renamed
    Path of this file changed from the previous revision;
    the text may also have changed.  This includes files whose
    parent directory was renamed.

modified
    Text has changed since the previous revision.

kind changed
    File kind has been changed (e.g. from file to directory).

unknown
    Not versioned and not matching an ignore pattern.

Additionally for directories, symlinks and files with a changed
executable bit, Bazaar indicates their type using a trailing
character: \*(Aq/\*(Aq, \*(Aq@\*(Aq or \*(Aq*\*(Aq respectively. These decorations can be
disabled using the \*(Aq\-\-no\-classify\*(Aq option.

To see ignored files use \*(Aqbzr ignored\*(Aq.  For details on the
changes to file texts, use \*(Aqbzr diff\*(Aq.

Note that \-\-short or \-S gives status flags for each item, similar
to Subversion\*(Aqs status command. To get output similar to svn \-q,
use bzr status \-SV.

If no arguments are specified, the status of the entire working
directory is shown.  Otherwise, only the status of the specified
files or directories is reported.  If a directory is given, status
is reported for everything inside that directory.

Before merges are committed, the pending merge tip revisions are
shown. To see all pending merge revisions, use the \-v option.
To skip the display of pending merge information altogether, use
the no\-pending option or specify a file/directory.

To compare the working directory to a specific revision, pass a
single revision to the revision argument.

To see which files have changed in a specific revision, or between
two revisions, pass a revision range to the revision argument.
This will produce the same results as calling \*(Aqbzr diff \-\-summarize\*(Aq.

    \-\-verbose, \-v             Display more information.

Set the branch of a checkout and update.

For lightweight checkouts, this changes the branch being referenced.
For heavyweight checkouts, this checks that there are no local commits
versus the current bound branch, then it makes the local branch a mirror
of the new location and binds to it.

In both cases, the working tree is updated and uncommitted changes
are merged. The user can commit or revert these as they desire.

Pending merges need to be committed or reverted before using switch.

The path to the branch to switch to can be specified relative to the parent
directory of the current branch. For example, if you are currently in a
checkout of /path/to/branch, specifying \*(Aqnewbranch\*(Aq will find a branch at
/path/to/newbranch.

Bound branches use the nickname of its master branch unless it is set
locally, in which case switching will update the local nickname to be
that of the master.

See also: commit, tags

Create, remove or modify a tag naming a revision.

Tags give human\-meaningful names to revisions.  Commands that take a \-r
(\-\-revision) option can be given \-rtag:X, where X is any previously
created tag.

Tags are stored in the branch.  Tags are copied from one branch to another
along when you branch, push, pull or merge.

It is an error to give a tag name that already exists unless you pass
\-\-force, in which case the tag is moved to point to the new revision.

To rename a tag (change the name but keep it on the same revsion), run \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr
tag new\-name \-r tag:old\-name\\*(Aq\\*(Aq and then \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr tag \-\-delete oldname\\*(Aq\\*(Aq.

If no tag name is specified it will be determined through the 
\*(Aqautomatic_tag_name\*(Aq hook. This can e.g. be used to automatically tag
upstream releases by reading configure.ac. See \\*(Aq\\*(Aqbzr help hooks\\*(Aq\\*(Aq for
details.

Alias: up

See also: pull, status\-flags, working\-trees

Update a working tree to a new revision.

This will perform a merge of the destination revision (the tip of the
branch, or the specified revision) into the working tree, and then make
that revision the basis revision for the working tree.  

You can use this to visit an older revision, or to update a working tree
that is out of date from its branch.

If there are any uncommitted changes in the tree, they will be carried
across and remain as uncommitted changes after the update.  To discard
these changes, use \*(Aqbzr revert\*(Aq.  The uncommitted changes may conflict
with the changes brought in by the change in basis revision.

If the tree\*(Aqs branch is bound to a master branch, bzr will also update
the branch from the master.

You cannot update just a single file or directory, because each Bazaar
working tree has just a single basis revision.  If you want to restore a
file that has been removed locally, use \*(Aqbzr revert\*(Aq instead of \*(Aqbzr
update\*(Aq.  If you want to restore a file to its state in a previous
revision, use \*(Aqbzr revert\*(Aq with a \*(Aq\-r\*(Aq option, or use \*(Aqbzr cat\*(Aq to write
out the old content of that file to a new location.

The \*(Aqdir\*(Aq argument, if given, must be the location of the root of a
working tree to update.  By default, the working tree that contains the 
current working directory is used.

See also: check, formats, reconcile

Upgrade a repository, branch or working tree to a newer format.

When the default format has changed after a major new release of
Bazaar, you may be informed during certain operations that you
should upgrade. Upgrading to a newer format may improve performance
or make new features available. It may however limit interoperability
with older repositories or with older versions of Bazaar.

If you wish to upgrade to a particular format rather than the
current default, that can be specified using the \-\-format option.
As a consequence, you can use the upgrade command this way to
"downgrade" to an earlier format, though some conversions are
a one way process (e.g. changing from the 1.x default to the
2.x default) so downgrading is not always possible.

A backup.bzr.~#~ directory is created at the start of the conversion
process (where # is a number). By default, this is left there on
completion. If the conversion fails, delete the new .bzr directory
and rename this one back in its place. Use the \-\-clean option to ask
for the backup.bzr directory to be removed on successful conversion.
Alternatively, you can delete it by hand if everything looks good
afterwards.

If the location given is a shared repository, dependent branches
are also converted provided the repository converts successfully.
If the conversion of a branch fails, remaining branches are still
tried.

For more information on upgrades, see the Bazaar Upgrade Guide,
http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/latest/en/upgrade\-guide/.

Show version information about this tree.

You can use this command to add information about version into
source code of an application. The output can be in one of the
supported formats or in a custom format based on a template.

For example:

  bzr version\-info \-\-custom \\
    \-\-template="#define VERSION_INFO \\"Project 1.2.3 (r{revno})\\"\\n"

will produce a C header file with formatted string containing the
current revision number. Other supported variables in templates are:

  * {date} \- date of the last revision
  * {build_date} \- current date
  * {revno} \- revision number
  * {revision_id} \- revision id
  * {branch_nick} \- branch nickname
  * {clean} \- 0 if the source tree contains uncommitted changes,
              otherwise 1

Manage filtered views.

Views provide a mask over the tree so that users can focus on
a subset of a tree when doing their work. After creating a view,
commands that support a list of files \- status, diff, commit, etc \-
effectively have that list of files implicitly given each time.
An explicit list of files can still be given but those files
must be within the current view.

In most cases, a view has a short life\-span: it is created to make
a selected change and is deleted once that change is committed.
At other times, you may wish to create one or more named views
and switch between them.

To disable the current view without deleting it, you can switch to
the pseudo view called \\*(Aq\\*(Aqoff\\*(Aq\\*(Aq. This can be useful when you need
to see the whole tree for an operation or two (e.g. merge) but
want to switch back to your view after that.

Examples:
  To define the current view:

    bzr view file1 dir1 ...

  To list the current view:

    bzr view

  To delete the current view:

    bzr view \-\-delete

  To disable the current view without deleting it:

    bzr view \-\-switch off

  To define a named view and switch to it:

    bzr view \-\-name view\-name file1 dir1 ...

  To list a named view:

    bzr view \-\-name view\-name

  To delete a named view:

    bzr view \-\-name view\-name \-\-delete

  To switch to a named view:

    bzr view \-\-switch view\-name

  To list all views defined:

    bzr view \-\-all

  To delete all views:

    bzr view \-\-delete \-\-all
